PEARL WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INFANTILE WORLD.
IF SPOKEN TO, SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN.
IN TRUTH, SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT.
PEARL, SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES, BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE, AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED.
THE CAPTAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD.
THE GOAT'S WARLIKE SPIRIT WAS ROUSED BY THIS SUCCESSFUL ATTACK.
IT WILL BE SUCH A SATISFACTION.
THROUGH THE BLACK NIGHT RAIN, HE SANG TO HER WINDOW BARS.
SHE WAS ALONE THAT NIGHT.
HE HAD BROKEN INTO HER COURTYARD.
