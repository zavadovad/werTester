# werTester
This repository serves as an addition to the RemblexApp repository. It was used to test functionality and to calculate WER of Whisper transcriptions and transcriptions of TTS generated audios. Twenty LibriSpeech audios with transcripts are in the LibriSpeech folder.

## Installation Guide
You might need to install some of the requirements needed to run the Remblex application. The whole RemblexApp installation is recommended.

If you've already installed all of needed dependencies, you might just want to launch the Python virtual enviroment and then you can use these scripts however and whenever you want.
